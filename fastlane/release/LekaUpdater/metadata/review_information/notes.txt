This app is to allow user to update their Leka robot (https://leka.io)

Video showing how it connects and works with our Leka robot available here:

It is replacing our previous app after a complete rewrite of our update process.
See previous version here: https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/leka-updater/id6443763916?l=en-GB

The old app has been made unavailable in all countries and will then be removed from the store to avoid having two apps doing the same thing and duplicating functionality.
